# STATUS

Living status document for the Apeiron build-out. Updated whenever a
commit lands, a decision is reached, a relay to Claude (web) is sent or
returned, or an attempt fails in a way worth remembering.

- **Current date:** 2026-04-20.
- **Scope of this file:** *what is happening right now*, *what has been
  tried and abandoned*, *what questions are open*. Durable guidance
  (invariants, conventions, research strategy) lives in
  [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); this file is operational.

## Current focus

Module 6 of the CLAUDE.md §5.1 sequence: `hierarchy.py`. Sub-commits
A (`Supertile` + `expand_one`) and B (recognisability test +
Ammann–Beenker oracle) landed. Next: sub-commit C — inflation
argument (pillar 3) using P3 as oracle.

## Upstream relays with Claude (web)

Claude (web) authors `CLAUDE.md` and is the architectural upstream;
Shane relays Q&A. See the collab-relay memory in
`~/.claude/projects/-home-azathoth-Apeiron/memory/`.

- **2026-04-19 — Is the repo greenfield?** (§5 of CLAUDE.md claimed
  partially-built code; disk was empty.) **Resolved** — §5 was
  forward-looking; rewritten as acceptance criteria in `ca66913`.
- **2026-04-19 — Build backend** (hatchling vs uv vs poetry).
  **Resolved** — hatchling as PEP-517 backend, uv for env/dep
  management.
- **2026-04-19 — Rhombic triacontahedron vertex convention.**
  **Resolved** — 8 cube vertices, 12 dodecahedral cyclic perms,
  12 icosahedral cyclic perms; 32 vertices / 60 edges / 30 rhombi.
- **2026-04-19 — Where does the RTH I-transitivity test live?**
  **Resolved** — `tests/integration/` per the ≥-2-core-imports rule,
  codified in `tests/integration/README.md` (`10524d9`).
- **2026-04-19 — Icosahedral group matrices: ℤ[φ] or (½)ℤ[φ]?**
  **Resolved** — (½)ℤ[φ]; denominator globally bounded by 2 via the
  I-invariant lattice L. Stored as 2·g numerators under implicit
  denom 2. CLAUDE.md §3 rewritten in `eb8c537`.
- **2026-04-20 — Generator choice for `symmetry.py`.** Non-blocking,
  flagged for later relay if Claude (web) has a preferred canonical
  triple. Current choice: ROT_5 about (0, 1, φ), ROT_3 about
  (1, 1, 1), ROT_2 about the x-axis.
- **2026-04-20 — Convex-hull strategy: scipy or from-scratch?**
  **Resolved** — scipy as a *combinatorial* oracle (index triples
  only, floats discarded at the boundary), followed by three exact
  ZPhi validation predicates: orientation, interiority, Euler.
  Fallback to exact hull required if validation fires; currently a
  stub (`NotImplementedError`).
- **2026-04-20 — On-disk vertex convention for candidate files.**
  **Resolved** — ℤ[φ] author-form on disk (vertices as
  `[[a, b], [a, b], [a, b]]` triples), with `scale_denom` (default 1;
  only 2 otherwise permitted) handled at load time. Loader
  `load_candidate(path) -> Polyhedron` lives in `util.py`, not
  `polyhedron.py` — the latter stays pure geometry.
- **2026-04-20 — RTH vertex coordinates.** First draft (cube ×φ /
  dodec ×φ / icos ×φ all sharing cyclic-perm axes at z = ±φ²) gave a
  20-vertex convex hull, not 32 — the dodec vertices were strictly
  interior to edges between icos vertices. **Resolved** — corrected
  spec uses `(0, ±φ, ±1/φ)` for non-cube dodec positions (different
  z-levels from the icos set), landing all 32 intended vertices as
  hull extreme points. Full rationale in `docs/decisions.md`.
- **2026-04-20 — Strict-mode flag on the candidate loader.** Should
  `load_candidate` reject inputs that scipy drops as interior?
  **Resolved** — yes, default-on (`allow_interior_inputs=False`).
  The RTH-first-draft failure is exactly the silent-wrong-polyhedron
  case that needs loud surfacing at load time.
- **2026-04-20 — Acceptance oracle for `substitution.py`.** Which 2D
  Penrose-style rule to use as the PF / primitivity oracle?
  **Resolved** — Penrose P3 (thick/thin rhombus, PF = φ²) as primary
  for structural similarity to the 3D target (rhombic faces, φ-edge
  ratios); Fibonacci (PF = φ) as secondary diagnostic specifically to
  catch any code that hard-codes φ² as "the" canonical PF.
- **2026-04-22 — Face-to-face placement enumeration strategy.**
  Naive O(60 · F · n) scan with `find_rotation(target)` wrapping the
  `g ∈ I` lookup, or precomputed index over face-orbit
  representatives? **Resolved** — naive scan. The numbers don't
  justify the index yet (~65k int ops per corona-1 root, sub-second
  even for deep BFS). The correct precomputation once this becomes
  hot is orbit representatives of the tile's faces under I, not a
  face-pair index; committing to a specific index shape now would
  bake in the wrong abstraction. `find_rotation` is named so any
  future optimisation is a single-function swap.
- **2026-04-23 — `hierarchy.py` scoping (six questions).**
  **Resolved** — (a) `Supertile` is lazy-recursive
  ``(level, prototile_index, children)`` where ``children`` is the
  level-1 dissection only; (b) ``RecognisabilityResult`` carries
  either a ``witness: dict[hash, supertile_id]`` on success or an
  ``IndistinguishablePair`` counterexample on failure; (c)
  iterative-radius search with default cap 5 and a
  ``radius_cap_reached`` flag distinguishing
  "provably non-recognisable" from "unknown beyond cap"; (d)
  fourth pillar is *framework only* in this module — concrete
  ``FourthPillarArgument`` implementations live per-candidate in
  ``candidates/<name>/fourth_pillar.py``, since the case analysis
  is candidate-specific (~40 pages in the hat / spectre proofs);
  (e) Ammann–Beenker as the pillar-2 oracle (recognisability
  cleanly encoded per Baake & Grimm Vol. 1 §6), Penrose P3
  everywhere else; (f) ``@pillar(n)`` decorator added to
  ``util.py``, attaching ``fn._pillar = n``, plus a docstring line
  for human readability.
- **2026-04-22 — `angular_defect` return type.** Earlier
  "`angular_defect(config, feature) -> ZPhi`" was loose — the
  literal angle around an edge/vertex is transcendental in ℤ[φ], and
  `Σ 2·cos(θᵢ)` hitting a target is *not* equivalent to
  `Σ θᵢ = 2π` because cos isn't additive. **Resolved** — rename to
  `incidence_defect(config, feature) -> int` = face-count deficit at
  the feature (combinatorial closure only). Geometric non-overlap is
  a separate predicate, `has_interior_overlap(config) -> bool`; both
  are required for corona completeness and both are orthogonal.
  A matrix-product-around-edge closure check (the genuinely exact
  ℤ[φ] formulation) is added *alongside* these two if a concrete
  "combinatorially valid but geometrically non-realisable"
  configuration ever surfaces — not as a replacement.

## Attempts that failed and what we did instead

### scipy install via `/usr/bin/python3 -m pip`

**Tried** (2026-04-20): `python3 -m pip install --user 'scipy>=1.11'`
against `/usr/bin/python3`.

**Failed** with `No module named pip`. The system Python doesn't have
pip reachable; the apt-packaged `python3-scipy` exists (1.11.4) but
installing it would need sudo and would be a system-level change.

**Doing instead:** set up a project-local uv venv
(`uv venv && uv pip install -e '.[dev]'`), added `scipy>=1.11` to
`pyproject.toml`, re-synced — scipy 1.17.1 is now installed in the
venv. All test runs switched to `.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest`.

### `_` discard-variable in `test_symmetry.py`

**Tried** (2026-04-19): `with pytest.raises(IndexError): _ = v[3]`
to catch an expected IndexError.

**Failed** lint (ruff: unused-variable on `_`).

**Doing instead:** bare expression statement `with pytest.raises(...): v[3]`.

### `_raw_tetrahedron()[0]` in direct `Polyhedron(...)` construction tests

**Tried** (2026-04-20, commit B development): use the raw (non-
canonical) tetrahedron vertex list to test face-level rejection
branches in `Polyhedron.__post_init__`.

**Failed** because the vertex-canonical-order check fires *before*
the face-level checks, so none of the five face-rejection tests
hit their intended branch — they all raised the wrong error first.

**Doing instead:** added a `_canonical_tetra_vertices()` helper
returning vertices pre-sorted by the canonical key; the face-rejection
tests use this helper so they bypass the vertex-order gate and hit
the face-level gates as intended.

### Conjugation in `_apply_rotation_to_config`

**Tried** (2026-04-22, corona sub-commit D development): apply
``g ∈ I`` to a ``CoronaConfig`` via
``new_rotation = g.compose(n.rotation)``, with
``new_translation = g.apply(n.translation)``.

**Failed** because placements are expressed relative to the central's
frame. When the central rotates by ``g``, each neighbour's rotation
transforms by the adjoint action ``g ∘ g_n ∘ g⁻¹``, not by
left-multiplication ``g ∘ g_n``. Symptom: ``corona_1(cube)``
returned a "canonical" configuration whose ``has_interior_overlap``
fired — neighbour placed-vertex positions didn't match what
``g`` applied to the original positions would give.

**Doing instead:**
``new_rotation = g.compose(n.rotation).compose(g.inverse())``. Under
this correction the cube corona's canonical form passes every
completeness predicate and every per-test structural check
(6 face-sharers / 12 edge-sharers / 8 vertex-sharers, incidence
count 4 at every edge, 8 at every vertex, no interior overlap).

### Trusting scipy's simplex vertex order to be outward-oriented

**Tried** (2026-04-20, commit C development): use the simplex index
triples returned by `scipy.spatial.ConvexHull` directly — under the
assumption that `(b - a) × (c - a)` applied to each simplex gives the
outward normal consistently.

**Failed** on the stored-×2 unit cube: `from_vertices` produced 12
triangular faces instead of 6 quadrilaterals. Diagnosis — scipy
returns simplices with mixed orientations (some outward-facing, some
inward-facing) even within a single hull face. scipy's `hull.equations`
attribute is the authoritative outward normal per simplex, but it's
float metadata that we deliberately don't consume.

**Doing instead:** added `_orient_simplices_outward`, a pure-Z[φ]
reorientation pass that runs immediately after scipy and flips any
simplex whose exact normal points toward the hull centroid. Uses the
unscaled centroid direction `sum_v - n_count * a` (positive-scalar
multiple of `centroid - a`) to avoid division, and raises
`ValueError` if the centroid happens to be coplanar with a face
(which is impossible for a valid convex hull). After reorientation,
`_same_oriented_plane` correctly groups same-face simplices and the
coplanar-merge produces one quadrilateral per cube face.

### Claiming matrices of I have entries in ℤ[φ] (Cartesian)

**Tried** (2026-04-19, initial §3 of CLAUDE.md): state that every
g ∈ I is a SL(3, ℤ[φ]) matrix in the standard Cartesian basis.

**Failed** mathematically — the 5-fold rotation about (0, 1, φ) has
entries in (½)ℤ[φ]; the half-factors from cos(72°) = (φ−1)/2 and the
Rodrigues denominator do not cancel. `det(S) = 1` verified independently.

**Doing instead:** storage convention is ×2 scaling everywhere
(CLAUDE.md §3.2 and §3.3 as of `eb8c537`). `Rotation.matrix` holds
2·g with pure ℤ[φ] entries; `apply`/`compose` discharge the implicit
denominator 2 via `_halve_zphi`, which asserts exactness and
fails loudly on any parity violation. The L-invariant lattice (e₁ =
(1, φ, 0), e₂ = (φ, 0, 1), e₃ = (0, 1, φ); det V = −2φ²) is the
reason the denominator never grows under composition.

## Open questions / things to watch

- **Exact-arithmetic hull fallback.** Commit C ships a
  `NotImplementedError` stub for the case where scipy's validation
  fails. We don't hit this path for the standard fixtures
  (tetrahedron, cube, RTH) but the stub needs replacing before any
  candidate tile with near-degenerate geometry is attempted.
- **CLAUDE.md §7.1 phrasing.** Says "No SciPy for core arithmetic".
  Adding scipy as a combinatorial oracle is compatible with the
  *intent* (scipy is not used for ℤ[φ] arithmetic) but the letter of
  the rule reads more broadly. Proposed resolution deferred until after
  commit C: relay to Claude (web) for a one-sentence §7.1 clarification
  at the same time as any other CLAUDE.md edits we accumulate.
- **Canonical face-cycle direction.** Current canonicalisation rotates
  (preserving direction), which assumes the caller has provided
  outward-oriented faces. scipy's output is documented as outward-
  normal consistent; if this ever turns out to be wrong we'll see it
  immediately via `is_in_hull` rejecting all inputs.
